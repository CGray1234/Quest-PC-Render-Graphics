# Info

This mod is in VERY early development and some aspects may not function as intended. If something is not functioning properly, please submit an issue.

Beta/pre-release versions do get released, and you can tell which ones are beta by looking at the cover image. If it is glitchy, it is a beta version. If it looks normal, it is a working version.
